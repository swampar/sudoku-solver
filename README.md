Sudoku puzzles are becoming increasingly popular among the people all over the world. The game has become popular now in a large number of countries and many developers have tried to generate even more complicated and more interesting puzzles. To day, the game appears in almost every newspaper, in books and in many websites. The back tracking algorithm is formulated based on human techniques. Backtracking is a straight
forward and commonly used algorithmic technique for solving constraint satisfaction prob lems like Sudoku. It involves attempting to place digits in the Sudoku grid one by one and back-tracking whenever a conflict arises. This recursive method ensures that all possible
configurations are explored until a valid solution is found. The Brute force algorithm is then used to compare with this algorithm in order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algo rithm. The brute force is a general algorithm than can be applied to any possible problem. This algorithm generates any possible solutions until the right answer is found.
